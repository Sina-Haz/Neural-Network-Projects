This is a simple, feed-forward perceptron that takes in two inputs and a bias. It can solve linearly separable problems in the form of functions and
classifies points based off of a simple activation function that tests if any input point is above or below the line of the function. The perceptron 
is coded in java, however it uses the processing editor and library to run. This is becuase the code generates animations to visualize the training process. of the perceptron.
